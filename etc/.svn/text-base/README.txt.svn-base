The files in this directory are configuration files for launchd, which is the preferred way to run programs in the background (or periodically) on Mac OS X. They will need to be modified to suit your WattDepot installation, but should be helpful as a template.

The files should be placed in /Library/LaunchDaemons so that they will run when the system boots.
